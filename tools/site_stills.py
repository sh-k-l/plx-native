WHICH IMAGES. Exactly the ones a simulator makes, read from the tools that make them and not listed by hand
(`output_files`): every output of every scene in `tests/screenshots/scenes.json` (`tools/screenshots.py`: the
documentation figures under `docs/screenshots/`, the site's close-ups `site/media/closeup-*.jpg` and the link
card `site/media/og-card.jpg`) with the `CREDITS.md` that goes with the figures, the WebP and phone copies
`tools/render-site-variants.py` cuts from the close-ups, and the glows `tools/render-site-glows.py` bakes from
them. Not these: a photograph taken on the television (`docs/screenshots/navblur-transition.jpg`, which no tool
renders), the brand art under `assets/` and `site/icons/`, and the film's own posters and glows
(`tools/site_video.py` owns `site/media/feel-*`).

THE SAME SECURITY MODEL AS THE FILM (docs/agent-reference.md, "How the site's stills update themselves"):
`site-video.yml`'s `stills` job renders its own checkout and fails unless the two captures of every scene agree
within the noise bound below; its `publish` job runs THIS file from main (never the rendered ref's) on the
artifact, which is data. `adopt` refuses anything that is not `platform: linux-ci`, a file whose sha256 differs
from the manifest, a file set that is not exactly `output_files()`, a scene whose recorded pair is missing or over
the bound (the bound is re-read from main's scene manifest, never from the artifact), and (`--expect-rev`) an
artifact rendered from other inputs than that revision's. A set byte-identical to the committed one writes
nothing, the manifest included, so the manifest keeps naming the tree the stills were last rendered for. The
decision to render at all is `needs-render`: the stills' inputs' tree hash against the committed manifest, so an
app whose pixels cannot have changed commits no stills whatever the renderer's noise.

STABLE, NOT BIT-IDENTICAL. llvmpipe's blur and glass passes are not bit-stable from run to run (the scene
manifest's own words: "the GPU's run-to-run rounding"), so two renders of the same scene are not byte-identical
and demanding it fails nearly every run. What a still needs is that nothing in it is *different*: the same cards,
the posters loaded, the text where it was. That is what `tools/screenshots.py --check-determinism` measures on the
raw captures, before any JPEG quantization spreads one level of rounding over a block: every channel of every
pixel of the second capture within `max_delta` (default 1, per scene in `tests/screenshots/scenes.json`, with the
reason) of the first. A missing poster, a card that popped in late or a different row is tens of levels off.
The FIRST capture is the one adopted. Nothing is compared as a JPEG, WebP or glow: those are pure functions of
the adopted captures (one ffmpeg, one process).
