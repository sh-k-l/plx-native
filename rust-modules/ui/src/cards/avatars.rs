//! [`AvatarRow`] — the profile picker's circular avatar row, the one public wrapper over the L0
//! `card_row` primitives. It is not a card section: the
//! roster has no captions, no hold menu and no paging, so it is `Focusable` geometry plus a
//! spring cache and the two tile bodies, kept here so the picker names no L0 primitive.
