//! [`Grid`] — the poster grid with a collapsing caption band under the focused row: six
//! `poster_grid::STYLE` columns by default, any column count / style / left edge through
//! [`GridSpec`] (`poster_grid`'s `_in` functions are its geometry). The Collection page is its first
//! adopter; [`ScrollMode::External`] serves a grid inside a document another owner scrolls.
//!
//! It owns (unless external) the scroll, the caption bands and the focus pop ([`GridBands`], [`GridPop`]) and runs
//! the same arithmetic for draw, stops, `Focusable` placement and paging, so the rect a card is
//! drawn at, the stop it registers and the rect `place` answers are one value.
