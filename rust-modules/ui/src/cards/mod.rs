//! `plx_ui::cards` — the shared card sections (layer L1: the sections built on the L0 row and grid primitives).
//!
//! [`Shelf`] (one horizontal strip) and [`Grid`] (the six-column poster grid) own everything a card
//! section does that is not the screen's content: the focus pop, the let-go of the tile that lost
//! focus, scrolling to keep focus visible, the caption band, drawing the focused tile last, culling,
//! hit-map stops, `Focusable` placement, paging requests and idle. A screen supplies its content
//! through [`CardSource`] and reacts to the one [`CardEvent`] [`Shelf::on`] / [`Grid::on`] returns;
//! it writes no pop, stop, restore or paging code of its own (and, for the stack pages, no press
//! code either — see the exceptions under "One entry").
//!
//! The contract, fixed once for every section:
//!
//! - **One entry.** `on(ev, cx, src, fx)` is fed EVERY `ScreenEvent` the screen receives. It
//!   consumes Tick and FocusMoved and reports Activate / Hold / Want; a screen that skips the call
//!   gets no motion at all, which is visible, not subtle. It never says "handled": a screen still
//!   observes `FocusMoved` itself for whatever else it keeps.
//!   Three screens are exceptions to "reports Activate / Hold / Want": Home feeds `Tick` and
//!   `FocusMoved` only and keeps its own press paths, because a Continue Watching press is
//!   account-affecting; Library and Detail do feed every event but discard the returned
//!   [`CardEvent`] and keep their own `Activate` / `PressCommit` / `PressHold` handling (Library's
//!   item menu and review flow, Detail's section-aware activation). The `cards::Stack` pages
//!   (Collection, Person, Search) act on the event.
//! - **Elem-keyed.** The section remembers no focus. Each call it reads the ENGINE's focus
//!   (`cx.focus.current`, filtered to its entry) and resolves the element to an index through
//!   [`CardSource::index_of`], so a landing that reorders content cannot leave it naming another
//!   item. Events carry `H::Elem`. (The pop springs follow their elements — `pool.rs` — so a tick
//!   that finds the focused element at another index with NO `FocusMoved`, a
//!   content landing, MOVES the spring to the new index, snaps the cell it left to rest and shifts
//!   the scroll by the index delta so the tile does not move on screen — [`Landed`] reports it.
//!   A non-deliberate `FocusMoved` adopts the new card whole and snaps the old one to rest; only a
//!   deliberate move lets the old tile go over frames. At most one tile reads lifted in any frame,
//!   including the one between the landing and the tick.)
//! - **The pop rule.** A tile the engine reports focused that no deliberate move (`By::Dir` /
//!   `By::Pointer`) announced draws at FULL focus scale at once — a restore or reconcile is adopted
//!   whole, a page returns exactly as it was left. An unfocused tile draws at rest (or the live
//!   let-go of the one that just lost focus). A deliberate move grows from rest.
//!   A shelf whose page is still dissolving in is [`dormant`](Shelf::dormant): nothing is lifted
//!   under the fade, and the first awake tick grows the focused card from rest.
//! - **One frame convention.** A [`SectionFrame`]'s `y` is screen space; the painter handed to
//!   `draw` may carry any translate (see [`SectionFrame`]).
//! - **Press comes from the frame**, `cx.press` / `f.press` through `PressRead::dip_of()`, never the
//!   thread-local. The dip lands on the card the press OWNS (`PressRead::owner`), focused or not:
//!   an abandoned press springs back on the card that was pressed while its neighbour takes the
//!   ordinary focus pop. [`Shelf::place`] / [`Grid::place`] answer the live drawn rect and the stop the
//!   draw registers is the same value; `rest_rect` is the settled focus-scaled rect.
//! - **Idle.** Springs report their own motion; a settled section reports none and parks at exact
//!   rest. No call allocates except the focused tile's label.
//!
//! The L0 primitives (`card_row`, `poster_grid`) are `pub(crate)`: a screen cannot hand-assemble a
//! shelf or a grid. What a screen legitimately reads from them (the tile style and label types, the
//! row and band geometry its own layout is built from, the heading painters) is re-exported here;
//! the `cards` gate in `ci/check-deps.sh` is the backstop.
//! Tier 1 of the conformance suite (`tests.rs`) runs the same seven cases the real screens run
//! (`conformance`, Tier 2) against both components on `FixtureHost`.
