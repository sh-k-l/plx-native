//! `CardRow` — the shared animated poster-shelf component.
//!
//! The spring-and-tile primitive under [`cards::Shelf`](crate::cards::Shelf), `pub(crate)` L0: a
//! focus-scale [`Spring`] per cell and a horizontal scroll spring, with the tile rendering (poster,
//! big glow focus ring, resume bar, centered title). [`RowStyle::HOME`] is the single source of
//! the shelf's motion and geometry.
//!
//! The x/`base_y` positioning loop, the cull and the stops are the Shelf's; `CardRow` owns spring state and
//! the leaf tile draws and never draws a whole row itself. A screen never names it: it implements
//! `CardSource` and hands the content to `cards::Shelf` / `cards::Grid`. It is decoupled from any
//! focus globals / catalog: focus is a plain `Option<usize>`, the item art is a [`Art`] the caller
//! supplies.
